An analyst is analyzing a stock over a period of n days. The price of the stock on the i day is price[i], and the profit obtained is denoted by profit[i]. The analyst wants to pick a triplet of days (i, j, k) such that (i<j<k) and price[i] < print[j] < print[k] is maximized. 

Find the maximum total profit possible. If there is no valid triplet, return -1.

Example:
Consider n = 5, price = [1,5,3,4,6] profit = [2,3,4,5,6]
An optimal triplet (considering 1-based indexing ) profit = 4 + 5 +6 = 15, the maximum possible. So, the answer is 15.

Function Description:
complete the function getMaximumProfit in the editor below.
getMaximumProfit has the following parameters:
int price[n]: the prices of the stock on each day
int profit[n]: the profits obtained from the stock on each day

Returns:
long_int: the maximum possible total profit.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 4000

There are two samples:

Sample Input:
price = [2,3,1,5,9]
profit = [1,2,6,1,5]
Sample Output: 
12

Sample Input:
price = [4, 3, 2, 1]
profit = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Sample Output: 
-1
There is no valid triplet
